# chunkJavaClient

======================

A java based raw client chunk receiver which has also the chunk connector.

This work is created for my thesis application Multisource Video Streaming. 
Here you can find the http://www.aueb.gr/users/vsiris/publications/ss1_stream_implementation.pdf paper. 

It is only a part of the application.

======================

Those classes are responsible for the following procedures.  

* `Append` - Appends to a file the files that recieved from the server application
* `Downloader` - Calls the server, establish a connection, retrieves the chunks and saves them localy 

=====================

Feel free to use it!
